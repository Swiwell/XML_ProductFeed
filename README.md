# XML_ProductFeed
XML Product feed from an SQLite database file.
To run the code, you should simply open the python file (main.py) and select "Run" in a panel above. Code creates a XML file (if there is no such file) by converting the existing SQLite database file. In the repository there is already a generated output XML file included.
The feed follows all the required specifications of a Google Merchant Center.
