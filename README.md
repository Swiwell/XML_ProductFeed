# XML_ProductFeed
XML Product feed from an SQLite database file.
To run the code, you should simply download any python compatible application, open script directory in console and run the script by writing "main.py" in the console. Code creates a XML file (if there is no such file) by converting the existing SQLite database file. In the repository there is already a generated output XML file included.
The feed follows all the required specifications of a Google Merchant Center.
